#Java DSA Practice
Welcome to the Java DSA Practice repository! This repository contains all the Java files and programs I have written while practicing various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey and serve as a reference for others interested in understanding and implementing DSA in Java.

#Topics Covered
Arrays: Basic operations, rotations, searching, sorting, etc.
Linked Lists: Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists, etc.
Stacks: Stack implementation using arrays and linked lists, stack operations.
Queues: Queue implementation using arrays and linked lists, circular queues, priority queues.
Trees: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, tree traversals.
Graphs: Graph representations, graph traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS), shortest path algorithms.
Sorting: Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, heapsort.
Searching: Linear search, binary search, depth-first search, breadth-first search.
